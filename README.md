## Course description

This class will provide an in-depth, interactive look at creating web applications with React and Redux. React is a library for building the 'view layer' of an application, and Redux is a library for so-called 'one way data flow'. Together, they provide a framework for building declarative, testable and debuggable web-apps. This class is designed for students with some knowledge of Javascript.
